```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Distribution Base Functions"
        PDF[PDF Computation]
        CDF[CDF Computation]
        INV[Inverse CDF/Quantile]
        RND[Random Number Generation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Distribution Fitting"
        LL[Log-Likelihood]
        FIT[Parameter Estimation]
    end
    
    PDF --> LL
    CDF --> LL
    INV --> FIT
    LL --> FIT
```

Each distribution (`GED`, `Skewed T`, `Standardized T`) implements these six functions, providing a complete statistical toolkit for modeling error distributions in financial time series.

### 3.3 Time Series Modeling Framework

The ARMAX modeling framework integrates several components:

1. **Parameter Estimation**: `armaxfilter.m` performs model estimation using maximum likelihood.

4. **Model Selection**: `aicsbic.m` calculates information criteria for comparing models.
5. **Forecasting**: `armafor.m` generates forecasts from estimated models.
6. **GUI Interface**: `ARMAX.m` and related files provide a graphical interface for model building.

This integrated approach allows for sophisticated time series modeling with robust diagnostics and visualization.

### 3.4 Volatility Modeling System

The volatility modeling framework includes:

1. **Model Specification**: Various GARCH variants (standard, EGARCH, TARCH, IGARCH, AGARCH, NAGARCH).
2. **Parameter Estimation**: `*fit.m` functions use maximum likelihood with MEX optimization.
3. **Initialization**: `garchinit.m` and `backcast.m` provide intelligent starting values.
4. **Likelihood Computation**: `garchlikelihood.m` calculates model likelihood with different error distributions.
5. **Forecasting**: `garchfor.m` generates volatility forecasts.
6. **Multivariate Extensions**: `ccc_mvgarch.m`, `dcc_mvgarch.m`, `bekk_mvgarch.m`, and `gogarch.m` handle multivariate volatility.

This comprehensive approach to volatility modeling supports the most widely used models in financial econometrics.

### 3.5 MEX Optimization Framework

The MEX optimization framework accelerates computationally intensive operations:

3. **Optimization**: Numerical optimization using MATLAB's `fminsearch` or similar.
4. **Standard Errors**: Computed from numerical Hessian or robust sandwich estimators.
5. **Diagnostics**: Comprehensive tests for model adequacy.

This unified approach to maximum likelihood estimation ensures consistent behavior across different models.

### 4.3 Bootstrap Implementation Pattern

Bootstrap methods follow a structured approach:

1. **Resampling Strategy**: Block-based or stationary resampling preserving temporal dependence.
2. **Statistic Computation**: Flexible computation of bootstrap statistics.
3. **Confidence Interval Construction**: Multiple methods (percentile, bias-corrected).
4. **Parallelization**: Efficient implementation suitable for parallel execution.

This framework provides robust inference tools for financial time series analysis.

## 5. Advanced Usage Patterns

2. **Binary Selection**: Loading appropriate MEX files (`.mexw64` or `.mexa64`)
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Pure MATLAB implementations when MEX fails
4. **Compilation Flags**: Consistent compilation settings for different platforms

### 6.3 Memory Management

Efficient memory usage is achieved through:

1. **Pre-allocation**: Arrays are pre-allocated to avoid dynamic resizing
2. **In-place Operations**: Modifying arrays in-place when possible
3. **MEX Memory Management**: Careful allocation/deallocation in C code
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Systematic cleanup of temporary resources

## 7. Conclusion

The MFE Toolbox provides a comprehensive framework for financial econometrics, with a modular, well-structured codebase that balances performance, flexibility, and usability.

#include "mex.h"
#include "matrix.h"
#include <math.h>

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[], int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[]) {
    /* Step 1: Input validation */
    if (nrhs != EXPECTED_NUMBER) {
        mexErrMsgIdAndTxt("MFEToolbox:functionName:invalidNumInputs",
                         "Required number of inputs not provided.");

# Multivariate Analysis Module

## Overview
The multivariate module of the MFE Toolbox provides comprehensive tools for multivariate time series analysis and volatility modeling in financial econometrics applications. This module implements a wide range of sophisticated statistical techniques for analyzing relationships between multiple financial time series, including Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling, Vector Error Correction Models (VECM), multivariate GARCH models, and factor analysis. These tools enable researchers and practitioners to model complex dependencies in financial markets, analyze volatility spillovers, estimate dynamic correlations, and perform structured analysis of co-movements in asset returns.

The module integrates sophisticated statistical techniques with optimization routines for high-performance computation of complex multivariate relationships in financial data. All implementations emphasize numerical stability, computational efficiency, and theoretical rigor to ensure reliable results for both research and production applications.

## Models Implemented

### Vector Autoregression (VAR)
The VAR implementation provides a complete framework for analyzing multivariate time series relationships. It allows for estimating dynamic relationships between multiple variables, capturing feedback effects and time-lagged interactions. Key features include:

- Parameter estimation for VAR models of arbitrary order
- Granger causality testing to identify predictive relationships
- Impulse response analysis to trace the effect of shocks through the system
- Forecast error variance decomposition to quantify contributions to variability
- Model order selection based on information criteria (AIC, BIC)
- Comprehensive diagnostic testing for model adequacy
- Forecasting capabilities with confidence intervals

The implementation handles both stationary and trend-stationary processes with options for deterministic trend specification.

### Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)
The VECM implementation extends VAR modeling to handle cointegrated time series, providing tools to model both long-run equilibrium relationships and short-run dynamics. Key features include:

- Johansen's procedure for cointegration rank testing
- Estimation of the cointegrating vectors and adjustment coefficients
- Model specification with various deterministic trend assumptions
- Hypothesis testing on cointegrating vectors
- Impulse response analysis for cointegrated systems
- Forecasting with error correction mechanisms

This implementation is particularly useful for modeling relationships between non-stationary financial variables that share common stochastic trends.

### Factor Models
The factor model implementation provides tools for dimension reduction and common factor extraction in multivariate financial data. These models help identify latent factors driving asset returns, enabling more efficient risk management and portfolio construction. Key features include:

- Principal component-based factor extraction
- Maximum likelihood estimation of factor models
- Factor rotation for improved interpretability
- Factor score computation
- Tests for factor adequacy and model selection

The implementation supports both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis approaches.

### Multivariate GARCH Models
The multivariate GARCH suite provides comprehensive tools for modeling time-varying covariances between financial assets. These models are essential for understanding risk dynamics, portfolio optimization, and hedge ratio determination. The module implements several key multivariate GARCH specifications:

- **Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC-GARCH)**: Assumes time-invariant correlations while allowing for time-varying volatilities. Computationally efficient for larger systems.
  
- **Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC-GARCH)**: Extends CCC by allowing for time-varying correlations, capturing changing dependence structures over time. Implements efficient two-stage estimation.
  
- **BEKK-GARCH**: Directly models conditional covariance matrices with guaranteed positive definiteness. Supports full, diagonal, and scalar specifications with various targeting options.
  
- **Generalized Orthogonal GARCH (GO-GARCH)**: Applies univariate GARCH models to orthogonal components of multivariate time series, providing dimension reduction and computational efficiency.

All multivariate GARCH implementations include:
- Maximum likelihood estimation with various distribution options
- Robust two-stage estimation procedures
- Forecasting capabilities for volatilities and correlations
- Diagnostic checking and model comparison tools
- Integration with MEX acceleration for performance

## Implementation Details

### MEX Acceleration
Performance-critical components of the multivariate module are accelerated using MEX C implementation. This is particularly important for likelihood evaluation in multivariate GARCH models, where computational demands grow rapidly with the dimension of the system. The module integrates with C-based components through the MEX interface, providing substantial speedups for larger datasets.

Key accelerated components include:
- Covariance matrix construction in multivariate GARCH models
- Likelihood evaluation for high-dimensional systems
- Integration with `composite_likelihood.c` for efficient estimation in large dimensions
- Optimized matrix operations for time-critical operations

MEX acceleration achieves >50% performance improvement over pure MATLAB implementations, enabling analysis of larger datasets and more complex model specifications.

### Numerical Stability
The multivariate module employs robust implementations focused on numerical stability, which is critical for multivariate volatility models that may encounter ill-conditioned matrices or challenging optimization surfaces. Key numerical stability features include:

- Robust correlation matrix computation with positive definiteness checks
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector calculations optimized for symmetry and conditioning
- Matrix inversion routines with stability checks and conditioning diagnostics
- Variance targeting initialization for improved convergence
- Regularization techniques for high-dimensional covariance estimation
- Parameter constraints enforcement throughout optimization
- Specialized algorithms for positive definite matrix enforcement

These techniques ensure reliable results even for challenging datasets or complex model specifications.

### Optimization Techniques
The multivariate module implements specialized optimization strategies to handle the complex likelihood surfaces of multivariate volatility models. Key optimization techniques include:

- Two-stage estimation procedures for multivariate GARCH models, first fitting univariate models and then correlation parameters
- Advanced constraints to ensure valid parameter spaces (e.g., positive definiteness of covariance matrices)
- Parameter targeting to reduce dimensionality of optimization problems
- Multiple starting values to avoid local optima
- Sequential quadratic programming for constrained optimization
- Analytical gradients for performance-critical components
- Specialized line search procedures for improved convergence

These optimization techniques enable reliable estimation of complex multivariate models even in challenging data environments.
